## Any issues with hosting and domain that can interfere with the website accessibility will be solely the responsibility of the faculty
    
### Evaluation 
- Likelihood: Very low, as the hosting solution (Digital Ocean) guarantees an average up time of over 99%
- Impact: Very high, as it will compeltely block access to the posted materials
    
### Mitigation Strategy
- Make sure that crucial files such as tests and quizzes are hosted in a system for which the faculty bears no individual responsibility (Blackboard)
- Make sure to use a hosting solution that ensures a very high up time probability
- Provide students with a direct IP address in case the domain service (marceljar.ca) fails
  
### Contigency Plan
- If all else fails, the slides can be presented from the faculty's localhost and recorded as a video lecture
    
## Some of the contracted services can have sudden price hikes
## The faculty can inadvertently make changes that will cause the system to become unaccessible/unreliable
## Students might find it har to navigate a new system outside of the ones already offered by the college (Blackboard)
