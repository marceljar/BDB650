**Report name:** Faculty Website, February 4th, 2022

**Project status:** On track

**Summary:**

Front-end and Back-end progressing well. In the front-end side, different views have been created showing a landing page, a course page, as well as calendar pages. In the back-end domain, models have been set up and tests involving HTTP requests show that the authentication process is working as designed.

**Front-End:**

- Boostrap added to the filesystem
- Several views, showcasing the responsiveness of the framework, have been created

**Back-End:**

- Models to store user account information have been created
- Functionality to create sessions based on whether the user sent the proper credentials via HTTP request have been finalized. Still missing the UI components

**Additional notes or highlights:**

- Still trying to decide where to host the website. Digital Ocean and Heroku are the current main contenders

**Issues/challenges:**

- Obtaining an SSL certificate might incur in unexpected costs
